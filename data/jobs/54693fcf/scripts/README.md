# Test Automation Scripts - Job 54693fcf

## Overview
This directory contains automated test scripts generated for testing https://10.34.50.201/dana-na/auth/url_admin/welcome.cgi.

**Total Test Cases**: 20
**Target Environment**: dev
**Browser**: chromium

## Setup

1. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

## Running Tests

### Run all tests:
```bash
pytest
```

### Run specific test:
```bash
pytest test_tc_001.py
```

### Run with HTML report:
```bash
pytest --html=report.html
```

### Run in parallel:
```bash
pytest -n 4
```

## Test Cases

- **TC_001**: Verify Profiler processes SNMP linkUp trap to mark endpoint as connected (Critical priority)
- **TC_002**: Verify Profiler processes SNMP linkDown trap to mark endpoint as disconnected (Critical priority)
- **TC_003**: Verify Profiler processes MAC address change notification trap for endpoint moving ports (High priority)
- **TC_004**: Verify SNMP trap based discovery of endpoints connected briefly to the switch (High priority)
- **TC_005**: Verify SNMP trap processing for multiple simultaneous endpoint events on a switch (Medium priority)
- **TC_006**: Verify handling of SNMP trap from non-configured (unknown) switch (High priority)
- **TC_007**: Verify handling of SNMP trap with incorrect community string (High priority)
- **TC_008**: Verify handling of malformed SNMP trap (corrupted PDU) (High priority)
- **TC_009**: Verify Profiler behavior when SNMP trap listener port (162) is unavailable (Medium priority)
- **TC_010**: Verify boundary condition for maximum number of SNMP devices sending traps (Medium priority)
- **TC_011**: Verify minimum/empty SNMP trap configuration (no devices configured) (Low priority)
- **TC_012**: Verify SNMP trap rate threshold (burst traffic) handling (High priority)
- **TC_013**: Verify integration between SNMP trap-based discovery and SNMP polling (MAC/ARP tables) (High priority)
- **TC_014**: Verify integration of SNMP trap-based discovery with Device Attribute Server (Medium priority)
- **TC_015**: Verify security: unauthorized user cannot modify SNMP trap configuration (High priority)
- **TC_016**: Verify security: SNMPv3 trap with invalid authentication is rejected (High priority)
- **TC_017**: Verify security: SNMP trap payload is sanitized and not executed as code (Medium priority)
- **TC_018**: Verify performance under moderate sustained SNMP trap load (Medium priority)
- **TC_019**: Verify performance of SNMP trap-based detection latency for new endpoints (High priority)
- **TC_020**: Verify integration with SSH-based collector when SNMP trap-based discovery occurs on Palo Alto device (Medium priority)
