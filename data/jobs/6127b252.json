Create new profile group with Name `XSS_Test_Group`.  \n2. Paste the malicious Description value.  \n3. Save the profile group.  \n4. Navigate away and return to edit `XSS_Test_Group`.  \n5. Observe if any popups or script execution occurs when viewing the page.  \n6. Inspect HTML source (via browser dev tools) to confirm encoding of description.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- No JavaScript executes; no alert popups.  \n- Description is either displayed as plain text (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=\"alert('xss')\">`) or stripped.  \n- HTML source shows characters encoded (e.g., `&lt;img ...&gt;`).  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- System not vulnerable to stored XSS via Description field.  \n\n---\n\n#### TC_019  \n**Test ID:** TC_019  \n**Test Title:** SQL injection attempt in profile group name  \n**Category:** security  \n**Priority:** High  \n\n**Description:**  \nConfirm the system is not susceptible to SQL injection via the Name field.\n\n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Admin logged in.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- Name: `PG_Test'); DROP TABLE profile_groups;--`  \n- Description: `SQLi test`  \n\n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Navigate to Profiler > Profile Groups > New Profile Group.  \n2. Enter the SQL injection string in Name.  \n3. Enter `SQLi test` in Description.  \n4. Click “Save Changes”.  \n5. After response, navigate to Profile Groups list and confirm existing groups are still present.  \n6. Check system logs (if available) for SQL error messages.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- No SQL error messages appear in UI.  \n- The system does not crash or behave abnormally.  \n- Either the input is rejected as invalid or saved safely as literal text.  \n- Existing tables and profile groups remain intact.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- Database schema unchanged; no data loss.  \n\n---\n\n#### TC_020  \n**Test ID:** TC_020  \n**Test Title:** Load test – create and list large number of profile groups  \n**Category:** performance  \n**Priority:** Medium  \n\n**Description:**  \nAssess performance when managing a high number of profile groups and ensure UI remains responsive.\n\n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Load test environment.  \n- Ability to use API/script for bulk creation if UI is slow.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- 500 profile groups named `PG_Load_001` to `PG_Load_500`.  \n\n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Using API or UI, create 500 profile groups with simple description and no profiles/tags.  \n2. Navigate to Profiler > Profile Groups in UI.  \n3. Measure time to load the profile group list page.  \n4. Use search/filter (if available) to find `PG_Load_250` and measure response time.  \n5. Scroll through the full list and observe any rendering delays or errors.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- Page load for profile group list completes within acceptable SLA (e.g., < 3 seconds; adjust to product requirements).  \n- Search/filter operation completes within SLA (e.g., < 2 seconds).  \n- UI remains responsive; no script timeouts or “unresponsive script” errors.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- 500+ profile groups remain in system for further scalability tests.  \n\n---\n\n#### TC_021  \n**Test ID:** TC_021  \n**Test Title:** Concurrent profile group edits by multiple admins  \n**Category:** performance / integration (concurrency)  \n**Priority:** High  \n\n**Description:**  \nValidate system behavior and data integrity when two admins attempt to edit the same profile group concurrently.\n\n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Two admin accounts: `admin1`, `admin2`.  \n- Existing profile group `Concurrent_Test` with Description `Initial`.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- `admin1` new Description: `Edited by admin1`.  \n- `admin2` new Description: `Edited by admin2`.  \n\n**Test Steps:**  \n1. `admin1` logs in and opens `Concurrent_Test` in edit mode.  \n2. `admin2` logs in from a different browser/session and opens `Concurrent_Test` in edit mode.  \n3. `admin1` changes Description to `Edited by admin1` and clicks Save.  \n4. Wait for save to complete.  \n5. `admin2`, without refreshing, changes Description to `Edited by admin2` and clicks Save.  \n6. Re-open `Concurrent_Test` in a new session and check final description.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- System handles concurrent edits gracefully:  \n  - Either detects stale data (optimistic locking) and rejects `admin2`’s save with a clear message,  \n  - Or last write wins but without data corruption.  \n- No system errors or corrupted configuration.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- `Concurrent_Test` has a consistent final state according to the conflict resolution strategy.  \n\n---\n\n#### TC_022  \n**Test ID:** TC_022  \n**Test Title:** Stress performance – auto tag evaluation under high asset churn  \n**Category:** performance  \n**Priority:** High  \n\n**Description:**  \nEvaluate performance of automatic tag assignment rules when a large number of assets change group membership rapidly.\n\n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Profile group `IT_Managed_Devices` with several complex tag rules.  \n- Load generator capable of simulating 5,000 endpoints connecting/disconnecting or changing attributes.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- 5,000 simulated endpoints with varying profiles and attributes.  \n\n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Configure load generator to simulate 5,000 endpoints over 10 minutes, with each endpoint’s attributes changing such that group membership and tag rules are frequently re-evaluated.  \n2. Monitor CPU, memory, and application logs on profiler server.  \n3. During the load, periodically navigate to `IT_Managed_Devices` > View Assets to verify counts and tagging.  \n4. Measure time for UI to load assets view during peak load.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- Auto-tagging logic keeps up with incoming updates without significant backlog (no large delays in tag assignment).  \n- Server remains stable without crashes or excessive resource usage beyond defined thresholds.  \n- Asset view response times remain within acceptable limits or degrade gracefully but without failures.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- System returns to normal resource usage after test; no persistent instability.  \n\n---\n\n===",
  "test_plan": ": TEST PLANNING ANALYSIS ===  \n\n**1. Feature Overview**  \nThe tests cover **Profile Configuration** within Pulse Policy Secure Profiler, focusing on:  \n- Creating, editing, and managing **Profile Groups** (name, description, profiles).  \n- Configuring and managing **automatic tag assignment rules** based on profile group membership and device/user attributes.  \n- Viewing **assets** associated with profile groups.  \n- Integration with attribute sources (Device Attribute Server, MDM, LDAP) and PPS/PCS role-mapping.  \n\n**2. Test Objectives**  \n- Validate correctness and robustness of profile group CRUD operations.  \n- Ensure tagging rules are configurable, validated, persisted, and executed correctly.  \n- Confirm accurate asset association and visibility under profile groups.  \n- Verify secure handling of inputs and proper authorization for profile configuration.  \n- Confirm integrations with external components (attribute server, MDM/LDAP, PPS remote profiler).  \n- Assess performance and concurrency behavior under realistic and high-load conditions.  \n\n**3. Coverage Analysis (by category)**  \n- Positive: TC_001, TC_002, TC_003, TC_004, TC_005, part of TC_013 → **5–6 tests**  \n- Negative: TC_006, TC_007, TC_008, TC_009, TC_010 → **5 tests**  \n- Boundary: TC_011, TC_012, TC_013 → **3 tests**  \n- Integration: TC_014, TC_015, TC_016, TC_021 (partially) → **3–4 tests**  \n- Security: TC_017, TC_018, TC_019 → **3 tests**  \n- Performance: TC_020, TC_021, TC_022 → **3 tests**  \n\n(22 test cases total; some cover multiple dimensions like boundary+positive or performance+integration.)  \n\n**4. Risk Areas / High-Priority Focus**  \n- **Authorization / RBAC** (TC_017): Misconfigured permissions could allow unauthorized changes to profiling configuration affecting security posture.  \n- **Input Sanitization / XSS / SQLi** (TC_008, TC_018, TC_019): Profile and tag configurations often display across admin UIs; stored XSS or injection could be critical.  \n- **Integration with attribute servers / MDM / LDAP / PPS** (TC_014–TC_016): Misbehavior may lead to incorrect policy and role-mapping for thousands of endpoints.  \n- **Auto-tagging correctness and performance under load** (TC_002, TC_013, TC_022): Incorrect or delayed tags directly impact access decisions and compliance.  \n- **Concurrency and configuration consistency** (TC_009, TC_021): Race conditions or stale updates can lead to unpredictable policies.  \n\nThese areas warrant deeper regression suites, additional negative scenarios, and monitoring of logs and security alerts during execution.",
