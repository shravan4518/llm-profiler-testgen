  "test_plan": ": TEST PLANNING ANALYSIS\n\n1. **Feature Overview:**  \n   These tests cover the **Troubleshooting Tools** feature accessible via `Profiler -> Profiler Configuration -> Troubleshooting`, focusing on the **Select Test (dropdown) [REQUIRED]** and **Run diagnostics** action, plus their integration with **Basic Profiler Configuration** and **Advanced Profiler Configuration** settings (e.g., DHCP Sniffing Mode, NMAP Profiling, SNMP (Host) configuration, Polling Interval, Subnets).\n\n2. **Test Objectives:**  \n   - Validate that each diagnostic test (DHCP Test, Switch Diagnostics, SNMP (Host) Test, NMAP Scan Test, Trap Test, SMTP Test, and WMI/SSH-related diagnostics) executes correctly under valid configurations.  \n   - Confirm that all documented diagnostic error conditions are correctly triggered and surfaced: Password Decryption Failure, WMI connection failed, WMI Query Failed, SSH Connection failed, SSH Command Failed, SMTP error, Failed to fetch device attributes through SNMP.  \n   - Verify required field behavior for **Select Test**, input validation, and security controls (authorization and injection resilience).  \n   - Assess interactions between diagnostics and configuration layers (Basic/Advanced Profiler Configuration) and their behavior under scale and concurrency.\n\n3. **Coverage Analysis (by category in this set):**  \n   - **Positive:** 6 tests (TC_001, TC_002, TC_003, TC_004, TC_005, TC_006, plus TC_023 partly)  \n   - **Negative:** 8 tests (TC_007, TC_008, TC_009, TC_010, TC_011, TC_012, TC_013, TC_020, TC_024)  \n   - **Boundary:** 3 tests (TC_016, TC_021, TC_025)  \n   - **Integration:** 4 tests (TC_014, TC_015, TC_022, TC_023)  \n   - **Security:** 2 tests (TC_017, TC_018)  \n   - **Performance:** 2 tests (TC_019, TC_025)  \n\n   Categories overlap slightly for some cases (e.g., TC_023 as integration + positive), but the above reflects primary classification.\n\n4. **Risk Areas / High-Priority Focus:**  \n   - **Credential Handling and Decryption:** High risk around \"Password Decryption Failure\" impacting all diagnostics using stored credentials.  \n   - **Remote Connectivity (WMI/SSH/SNMP/SMTP):** Multiple failure modes; critical for accurate diagnostics and must be thoroughly validated.  \n   - **Configuration Dependencies:** Diagnostics rely heavily on correct Basic and Advanced Profiler Configuration (DHCP Sniffing Mode, NMAP Profiling, Community List, Polling Interval, Subnets) – misalignment may lead to misleading results.  \n   - **Scalability:** Behavior when discovered devices exceed 1000 and while using manual Subnets configuration.  \n   - **Security & Access Control:** Ensuring only authorized admins can run diagnostics and that inputs like **Select Test** are not exploitable via injection.  \n   - **Concurrency & Performance:** Running multiple diagnostics concurrently and repeated runs must not degrade system performance or stability.",
