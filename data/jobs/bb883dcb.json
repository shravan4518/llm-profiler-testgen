Click `Delete Profiler` for `LocalProfiler01`.  \n6. Confirm any warning prompts to proceed with deletion.  \n7. After deletion, return to the `Diagnostic Logs` tab and attempt to refresh or access profiler-specific logs.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- Step 5–6: System either:  \n  - Prevents deletion and shows a message indicating Profiler is in use; OR  \n  - Allows deletion but gracefully handles the loss of profiler-specific logging in the Diagnostic Logs view (e.g., no crash, logs may become unavailable with clear messaging).  \n- No orphaned references or unhandled exceptions in the UI.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- Depending on product behavior, Profiler may be deleted or deletion blocked. System remains consistent.  \n\n---\n\n#### TC_019\n**Test Title:** Boundary – Verify handling of empty Diagnostic Logs (no entries)\n**Category:** boundary  \n**Priority:** Low  \n**Description:** Confirm that the Diagnostic Logs UI behaves correctly when no Profiler Diagnostic entries exist (fresh installation or logs purged).  \n**Prerequisites:**  \n- New PPS/Profiler deployment or logs purged/disabled such that there are currently no diagnostic log entries.  \n- Profiler Diagnostic Logging disabled or just enabled with no activity yet.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- None (empty logs scenario).  \n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Log into PPS as `ppsadmin`.  \n2. Navigate to `Maintenance > Troubleshooting > Monitoring > Diagnostic Logs`.  \n3. Observe the grid/list area where logs would normally appear.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- UI displays a clear message such as “No diagnostic log entries found” instead of an error or broken grid.  \n- No pagination or export options are shown if there is no data (or they are disabled).  \n- No JavaScript or server errors are presented.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- Logging configuration remains unchanged.  \n\n---\n\n#### TC_020\n**Test Title:** Integration – Verify system errors and poller events logs in correlation with troubleshooting\n**Category:** integration  \n**Priority:** Medium  \n**Description:** Validate that when troubleshooting profiling issues, system error logs and poller event logs can be correlated with Profiler Diagnostic logs for the same time window.  \n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Profiler Diagnostic Logging enabled.  \n- Poller events logging and System errors logging enabled in “Select Events to Log”.  \n- Known misconfiguration that causes poller errors (e.g., invalid SNMP community on a test switch).  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- Network switch: `SW-TEST01` incorrectly configured SNMP community.  \n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Configure `SW-TEST01` in Profiler with an incorrect SNMP community string.  \n2. Allow Profiler to attempt polling for 10–15 minutes.  \n3. Navigate to `Logs > Events` (System errors and Poller events).  \n4. Filter for `Poller events` related to `SW-TEST01`.  \n5. Note timestamps of failed poll events.  \n6. Navigate to `Maintenance > Troubleshooting > Monitoring > Diagnostic Logs`.  \n7. Filter diagnostic logs for the same time window.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- Poller events log shows errors/failures accessing `SW-TEST01`.  \n- System errors (if any) related to polling or network issues appear in the logs.  \n- Profiler Diagnostic Logs for that period provide complementary detail (e.g., why profiling failed).  \n- Timestamps line up reasonably, allowing correlation for troubleshooting.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- Misconfigured SNMP on `SW-TEST01` remains until corrected in later tests.  \n\n---",
  "test_plan": ": TEST PLANNING ANALYSIS\n\n1. **Feature Overview:**  \n   - Troubleshooting and logging capabilities for Pulse Policy Secure Profiler, including:  \n     - Profiler Diagnostic Logging (enable/disable, persistence).  \n     - Viewing and filtering Diagnostic Logs, including specific event IDs PRO31748/PRO31749 for endpoint uploads to Pulse One.  \n     - Logging configuration via “Select Events to Log”.  \n     - Profiler Dashboard and its links to Device Discovery reports.  \n     - Integration with Pulse One (Forward and Sync Endpoint Data) and associated logs.  \n\n2. **Test Objectives:**  \n   - Verify that administrators can effectively configure and use Profiler Troubleshooting tools.  \n   - Ensure logs provide correct, correlated diagnostic information for profiling and integration issues.  \n   - Validate robustness against invalid inputs and misconfigurations.  \n   - Confirm secure access to logs without leaking sensitive data.  \n   - Assess basic performance under load and concurrency for troubleshooting views.  \n\n3. **Coverage Analysis:**  \n   - Positive: 6 tests (TC_001, TC_002, TC_003, TC_004, TC_005, TC_006)  \n   - Negative: 5 tests (TC_007, TC_008, TC_009, TC_018, implicitly TC_013 covers a negative path but categorized as integration)  \n   - Boundary: 3 tests (TC_010, TC_011, TC_019)  \n   - Integration: 3 tests (TC_012, TC_013, TC_020)  \n   - Security: 2 tests (TC_014, TC_015)  \n   - Performance: 2 tests (TC_016, TC_017)  \n\n4. **Risk Areas / High Priority Focus:**  \n   - Correct and persistent enabling/disabling of Profiler Diagnostic Logging (TC_001, TC_002).  \n   - Reliability and correctness of diagnostic data for endpoint uploads to Pulse One (TC_003, TC_012, TC_013).  \n   - Access control and sensitive data handling in logs (TC_007, TC_014, TC_015).  \n   - Behavior under resource constraints (low disk, high log volume; TC_008, TC_016, TC_011).  \n   - Usability and correctness of Profiler Dashboard and its navigation to detailed reports for operational troubleshooting (TC_005, TC_006).",
