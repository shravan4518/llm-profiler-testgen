Observe scanning behavior for both subnets.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- Settings save successfully.  \n- On-demand scan uses NMAP only for devices in subnet 10.80.1.0/24 (same subnet as PPS).  \n- For 10.90.1.0/24, NMAP is not used; other enabled collectors may still scan.  \n- No errors, but behavior adheres to constraint \"For on-demand scan, NMAP is supported only for devices in the same subnet as PPS.\"  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- On-demand scan results reflect NMAP scanning limited to PPS subnet only.  \n\n---\n\n### Summary of Test Case Categories\n- Positive: TC_001, TC_002, TC_003, TC_004, TC_005, TC_007, TC_008  \n- Negative: TC_010, TC_011, TC_012, TC_013, TC_019, TC_021, TC_023  \n- Boundary: TC_009, TC_014, TC_020  \n- Integration: TC_006, TC_015, TC_024  \n- Security: TC_017, TC_018, TC_021  \n- Performance: TC_016, TC_022  \n\n---",
  "test_plan": ": TEST PLANNING ANALYSIS\n\n1. **Feature Overview**  \n   The tests cover the **Advanced Profiler Configuration** screen (`Profiler -> Profiler Configuration -> Advance Configuration`). This includes WMI Configuration, SSH Configuration, SNMP (Host) Configuration, Device Attribute Server Configuration, Subnets Configuration, and the related actions: Save Changes, Reset, Delete Profiler, and Start On-Demand Scan. The focus is on validating each control’s constraints, interactions among collectors and device attribute server, and operational behaviors like on-demand scans.\n\n2. **Test Objectives**  \n   - Verify that all input controls respect their defined types, ranges, defaults, and constraints (e.g., Polling Interval 1–1440, Authentication Method range).  \n   - Ensure proper persistence and retrieval of configuration values after Save Changes and Reset actions.  \n   - Validate error handling for WMI/SSH/SNMP failures and invalid inputs (community lists, polling intervals, subnets).  \n   - Confirm integration between Advanced Configuration and downstream behaviors: device attribute polling, on-demand subnet scanning, and interaction with collectors (WMI, SSH, SNMP, NMAP).  \n   - Assess security aspects: role-based access to Advanced Configuration, input sanitization to prevent injection, and server-side validation against tampered data.  \n   - Evaluate performance implications under complex configurations and heavy load.\n\n3. **Coverage Analysis**  \n   - Positive: 7 tests (TC_001, TC_002, TC_003, TC_004, TC_005, TC_007, TC_008)  \n   - Negative: 7 tests (TC_010, TC_011, TC_012, TC_013, TC_019, TC_021, TC_023)  \n   - Boundary: 3 tests (TC_009, TC_014, TC_020)  \n   - Integration: 3 tests (TC_006, TC_015, TC_024)  \n   - Security: 3 tests (TC_017, TC_018, TC_021)  \n   - Performance: 2 tests (TC_016, TC_022)  \n\n   This distribution ensures broad coverage across functional correctness, robustness, boundary behavior, integration paths, security posture, and performance characteristics.\n\n4. **Risk Areas and Focus**  \n   - **Misconfiguration leading to network impact:** Polling Interval and “profile all discovered devices” options can generate high load; TC_009, TC_016, and TC_019 specifically address this.  \n   - **Collector connectivity failures:** WMI, SSH, and SNMP error paths are critical for diagnosability and admin feedback (TC_012, TC_013, TC_011).  \n   - **Data integrity and security:** Risks of XSS/HTML injection via text fields (Community List) and unauthorized configuration changes are covered by TC_017, TC_018, and TC_021.  \n   - **Scalability with large device counts:** Subnet-based scoping when >1000 devices are discovered is a key risk, addressed in TC_006, TC_016, and TC_020.  \n   - **NMAP limitations:** Ensuring adherence to “same subnet as PPS” constraint in on-demand scans (TC_024).\n\nAdditional exploratory and regression tests should be added around UI-specific behaviors (e.g., multiselect interactions, concurrent updates) and around any product-specific confirmation dialogs, but the above suite provides a production-ready core for Advanced Profiler Configuration.",
