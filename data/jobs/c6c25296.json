Log in as `Admin`.  \n2. Navigate to **Profiler > Dashboard and report > Dashboard**.  \n3. Identify any chart or numbered panel with non-zero count (for example, `Devices waiting to be Profiled`).  \n4. Click on that chart or numbered panel.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- The system navigates to **System > Reports > Device Discovery** (or equivalent device discovery report page).  \n- The device discovery report displays a filtered view corresponding to the clicked chart/panel category.  \n- The number of devices in the report is consistent with the count shown on the dashboard.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- Device Discovery report remains accessible; no navigation issues introduced.\n\n---\n\n#### TC_023\n**Test Title:** Validate Endpoint Data Forwarding and Sync Option Highlighting  \n**Category:** positive  \n**Priority:** Low  \n**Description:** Ensure that when the “Forward and Sync Endpoint Data” option is selected under Profiler, it is highlighted to indicate current action/page.  \n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Profiler navigation menu available with **Forward and Sync Endpoint Data** as an option.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- Menu: `Profiler` main tab.  \n- Submenu item: `Forward and Sync Endpoint Data`.  \n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Log in as `Admin`.  \n2. Click on **Profiler** in the navigation bar.  \n3. From the Profiler dropdown menu, select **Forward and Sync Endpoint Data**.  \n4. Observe the highlighting or styling of the menu item.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- After selection, **Forward and Sync Endpoint Data** is highlighted (e.g., bold or different color) indicating it is the current page/action as described.  \n- The main Profiler tab remains highlighted to indicate current module.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- User remains on Forward and Sync Endpoint Data page; navigation state is consistent.\n\n---\n\n#### TC_024\n**Test Title:** Unauthorized User Access to Profiler Advanced Configuration  \n**Category:** security  \n**Priority:** High  \n**Description:** Verify that only authorized users (e.g., admins) can access the Advance Profiler Configuration and that standard users are blocked.  \n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Two users defined: `Admin` with full Profiler permissions and `PulseUser` with limited/non-admin access.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- Admin user: `Admin`.  \n- Non-admin user: `PulseUser`.  \n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Log in as `PulseUser`.  \n2. Attempt to navigate to **Profiler > Profiler Configuration > Advance** via the UI.  \n3. If not visible, attempt direct URL access to the Advance Profiler Configuration page (copy URL from an admin session and paste into `PulseUser` browser).  \n4. Log out `PulseUser`.  \n5. Log in as `Admin`.  \n6. Navigate to the same Advance Profiler Configuration page.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- `PulseUser` cannot access the **Advance** configuration page:  \n  - Either the **Profiler** or **Advance** menu is not visible, or  \n  - Direct URL access is denied with an authorization error.  \n- `Admin` can fully access the **Advance** configuration page without restriction.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- No advanced configuration is changed by `PulseUser`; security boundaries are intact.\n\n---\n\n#### TC_025\n**Test Title:** Performance of Device Attribute Server Polling at Default Interval  \n**Category:** performance  \n**Priority:** Medium  \n**Description:** Assess that polling Device Attribute Server at default 720-minute interval does not impose immediate load and occurs only on schedule.  \n**Prerequisites:**  \n- Device Attribute Server configured and selected.  \n- Polling interval set to default 720 minutes.  \n\n**Test Data:**  \n- Polling interval: `720` minutes.  \n- Device Attribute Server: `DeviceAttrServer01`.  \n\n**Test Steps:**\n1. Log in as `Admin`.  \n2. Confirm in **Device Attribute Server Configuration** that `DeviceAttrServer01` is selected and polling interval is `720`.  \n3. Monitor system logs or scheduler configuration (if available) for next scheduled poll time.  \n4. Immediately after configuration, verify that no continuous or high-frequency polling to `DeviceAttrServer01` occurs.  \n5. Optionally simulate time passage (if test environment allows) or check that polling is aligned with scheduled interval.  \n\n**Expected Results:**  \n- After setting polling interval to `720` minutes, no excessive or immediate repeated polls are observed.  \n- Polling behavior is consistent with a long interval (e.g., scheduled at 720-minute intervals).  \n- System resource utilization due to Device Attribute Server polling remains minimal between scheduled polls.  \n\n**Postconditions:**  \n- Device Attribute Server polling remains configured at `720` minutes.\n\n---",
  "test_plan": ": TEST PLANNING ANALYSIS\n\n1. **Feature Overview:**  \n   These tests target the advanced and related configuration areas of the Pulse Policy Secure Profiler, including Advance Profiler Configuration (Local Profiler, WMI), Basic Configuration dependencies (SNMP Poll interval, DHCP Sniffing modes, DHCPv6Collector), Device Attribute Server polling, additional data collectors (MDM, LDAP), Profiler database import/export (CSV/CFG, password protection), agentless mode policy enforcement integration with user roles, dashboards, endpoint data forwarding/sync menus, footer license information, navigation, security access control, and basic performance aspects.\n\n2. **Test Objectives:**  \n   - Validate that all documented configuration options (e.g., Advance Profiler Configuration, WMI CONFIGURATION, Device Attribute Server polling interval=720, DHCPv6 packet capturing checkbox, DHCPv6 sniffing over external port, SNMP Poll interval, DHCP Sniffing modes) are accessible and persist correctly.  \n   - Ensure correct interaction between Profiler and other components (HTTP Attribute Server, MDM, LDAP, agentless user roles, Device Discovery reporting).  \n   - Confirm secure handling of Profiler database import/export, including password-protected CFG files and authorization controls to advanced configuration.  \n   - Verify UI navigation, dashboard/report integration, and license/footer information.  \n   - Check boundary and negative behaviors for key numeric fields and password protection.  \n   - Assess basic performance aspects like navigation responsiveness and scheduled polling behavior.\n\n3. **Coverage Analysis:**  \n   - **Positive:** TC_001, TC_002, TC_003, TC_004, TC_005, TC_006, TC_007, TC_008, TC_009, TC_016, TC_020, TC_021, TC_022, TC_023 → 14 tests  \n   - **Negative:** TC_017, TC_018, TC_019 → 3 tests  \n   - **Boundary:** TC_010, TC_011 → 2 tests  \n   - **Integration:** TC_012, TC_013, TC_014, TC_022 → 4 tests  \n   - **Security:** TC_015, TC_018 (also negative), TC_024 → 3 tests  \n   - **Performance:** TC_021, TC_025 → 2 tests  \n\n   Some tests map to multiple concerns (e.g., TC_018 for negative + security), but each has a primary category as requested.\n\n4. **Risk Areas:**  \n   - **Data Integrity / Configuration Persistence:** Advanced and basic configuration fields (especially SNMP Poll interval, DHCPv6Collector, Device Attribute Server polling interval) must persist correctly; misconfiguration could break profiling and discovery.  \n   - **Integration with External Systems:** Device Attribute Server, MDM, LDAP, and agentless role enforcement rely on correct integration; failures here reduce profiling accuracy and policy enforcement.  \n   - **Secure Import/Export:** Password-protected CFG handling is critical; weaknesses could expose device inventory or allow tampered databases to be imported.  \n   - **Access Control:** Non-admin users must not reach advanced Profiler configuration; misconfigurations here are high-risk.  \n   - **Profile Accuracy & Reporting:** Dashboard to Device Discovery report linkage must be correct so admins rely on accurate profiling visibility.  \n   - **IPv6/DHCPv6 Support:** Enabling/disabling DHCPv6Collector and sniffing over external ports is sensitive, particularly in dual-stack environments; misbehavior could impact IPv6 adoption scenarios.",
