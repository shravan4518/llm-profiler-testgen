Connect the device to the network segment with DHCP forwarding enabled to PPS.  \n2. Power on the device and allow DHCP request to be sent.  \n3. Monitor the DHCP traffic forwarded to PPS.  \n4. Check output logs or profiler interface for device detection.  \n**Expected Results:**  \n- PPS receives DHCP packets forwarded from switch/WLAN controller.  \n- The device is detected by the Profiler via DHCP fingerprinting.  \n- Device profile includes the MAC address, vendor, and device type.  \n**Postconditions:** Device is registered and visible in profiler device list.  \n\n---\n\n**TC_002**  \n**Title:** Validate Profiling of static IP address endpoint via ARP/SNMP fetch  \n**Category:** positive  \n**Priority:** High  \n**Description:** Confirm that endpoints with static IP addresses are detected via ARP or SNMP data fetch.  \n**Prerequisites:** Switch SNMP configured; device with static IP assigned (e.g., 192.168.100.50).  \n**Test Data:** Static IP device with MAC address 00:11:22:33:44:55, hostname \"StaticDevice1.\"  \n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Ensure SNMP polling is active at configured interval.  \n2. Connect the static IP device to the network.  \n3. Wait for the polling cycle to fetch ARP/CAM tables.  \n4. Observe Profiler logs or device list for detection.  \n**Expected Results:**  \n- Device with MAC 00:11:22:33:44:55 appears in Profiler with correct IP and vendor information.  \n- Device status shows as \"Active.\"  \n**Postconditions:** Static device is correctly profiled with ARP/SNMP data.  \n\n---\n\n**TC_003**  \n**Title:** Confirm device detection with DHCP relay forwarding enabled  \n**Category:** positive  \n**Priority:** Critical  \n**Description:** Validate that DHCP requests relayed using DHCP relay are captured and used for device profiling.  \n**Prerequisites:** DHCP relay configured on switch/router; DHCP server active.  \n**Test Data:** A new mobile device requesting DHCP IP (e.g., 10.10.10.50).  \n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Configure DHCP relay on the network device to forward DHCP requests to PPS.  \n2. Connect device and obtain DHCP IP.  \n3. Verify that PPS has received and parsed the DHCP request.  \n4. Check device detection log in Profiler interface.  \n**Expected Results:**  \n- PPS detects the DHCP request forwarded via relay.  \n- Device is profiled with MAC, vendor, and possibly OS info based on DHCP fingerprinting.  \n**Postconditions:** Device is listed with accurate profile information.  \n\n---\n\n**TC_004**  \n**Title:** Validate that DHCP fingerprinting does not detect static IP devices when no DHCP request present  \n**Category:** negative  \n**Priority:** High  \n**Description:** Ensure static IP devices without DHCP requests are not wrongly detected via DHCP fingerprinting.  \n**Prerequisites:** Static IP device connected, DHCP relay off, no DHCP request sent.  \n**Test Data:** Static IP device at 192.168.100.60 with MAC 00:AA:BB:CC:DD:EE.  \n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Connect static IP device without initiating DHCP request.  \n2. Turn on Profiler and observe device list.  \n3. Confirm no DHCP fingerprinting detection occurs for this device.  \n**Expected Results:**  \n- Device with static IP does not appear in DHCP fingerprinting detection logs.  \n- Device profile is only created if detected via ARP/SNMP.  \n**Postconditions:** Static IP device remains undetected via DHCP fingerprinting.  \n\n---\n\n**TC_005**  \n**Title:** Verify Profiler update interval applies to configuration changes  \n**Category:** boundary  \n**Priority:** Medium  \n**Description:** Check that configuration changes in Profiler (e.g., adding a subnet) take effect after 15 minutes or after manual service restart.  \n**Prerequisites:** Profiler setup with a changed configuration (new subnet added).  \n**Test Data:** New subnet 192.168.200.0/24 added to Profiler configuration.  \n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Save changes in configuration.  \n2. Wait 15 minutes.  \n3. Connect a device in the new subnet.  \n4. Verify detection in Profiler logs and device list.  \n**Expected Results:**  \n- After 15 mins, device in new subnet is detected and profiled.  \n- No detection occurs before 15 mins unless services are restarted.  \n**Postconditions:** Configuration change is effective after time delay.  \n\n---\n\n**TC_006**  \n**Title:** Test maximum number of MAC authorizations (500) limit and behavior when exceeded  \n**Category:** boundary  \n**Priority:** Critical  \n**Description:** Verify Profiler's handling when MAC authorization cache exceeds 500 entries.  \n**Prerequisites:** Profile with 500 MACs authorized.  \n**Test Data:** Generate 50 devices with unique MAC addresses (e.g., MACs from 00:11:22:33:44:00 to 00:11:22:33:44:32).  \n**Test Steps:**  \n1. Ensure 500 MAC authorizations are registered.  \n2. Add additional device with new MAC.  \n3. Attempt to authenticate this new device.  \n4. Observe Profiler's response and logs.  \n**Expected Results:**  \n- Profiler either blocks new MAC or requires external LDAP for >500 entries.  \n- Appropriate warning or error message is generated.  \n**Postconditions:** System remains stable; exceeds authorization cache limit handled per design.  \n\n---\n\n**TC_007**  \n**Title:** Verify device profiling when connected via 802.1x authentication  \n**Category:** positive  \n**Priority:** Critical  \n**Description:** Confirm that devices authenticating through 802.1x are profiled correctly, including MAC and OS info.  \n**Prerequisites:** Network setup with 802.1x enabled and Profiler configured to collect session info.  \n**Test Data:** Device with MAC 00:A1:B2:C3:D4:E5, OS Windows 10.  \n**Test Steps:**  \n1.
