Verify whether only one record exists and values are unchanged (idempotent behavior), or document if duplicates are created per product design.  \n**Expected Results:**  \n- Preferred behavior: device is updated or left unchanged, but no duplicate entries are created on repeated import of identical data.  \n- Database remains consistent and free of duplicates.  \n**Postconditions:**  \n- Only one device entry exists for MAC `11:22:33:44:55:66`.\n\n---",
  "test_plan": ": TEST PLANNING ANALYSIS\n\n1. **Feature Overview**  \n   The functionality under test is Profiler database import/export and upgrade handling, including:  \n   - Import/Export Profiler Device Data in Binary format (full database backup/restore, encrypted, overwrite semantics, session invalidation).  \n   - Import/Export Profiler Device Data in CSV format (append semantics, overwriting supported fields, override behavior, custom fields).  \n   - Import/Export of Profile Modifications database in Binary format (append modifications).  \n   - Interaction with broader Profiler features (Dashboard, Device Attribute Server, Forward and Sync Endpoint Data) and behavior across Profiler upgrades.\n\n2. **Test Objectives**  \n   - Verify that all supported import/export formats (Binary, CSV) function as documented.  \n   - Confirm overwrite vs append semantics for Binary vs CSV imports.  \n   - Validate field-level behavior (updates vs preserved attributes, override flag, manually edited devices).  \n   - Ensure data integrity and system stability during and after import/export and upgrades.  \n   - Confirm correct integration with dashboards/reports, Device Attribute Server, and sync configuration.  \n   - Enforce proper security controls around import/export (authorization, password protection).  \n   - Assess performance and scalability of import/export operations with large datasets.\n\n3. **Coverage Analysis**  \n   - Positive: TC_001, TC_002, TC_003, TC_004, TC_005, TC_006, TC_007, TC_008, TC_013, TC_014, TC_015, TC_016, TC_021, TC_022, TC_024 → 15 tests  \n   - Negative: TC_009, TC_010, TC_011, TC_012, TC_017, TC_023 → 6 tests  \n   - Boundary: TC_012 (date formats), TC_024 (minimal fields), TC_025 (repeated imports) → 3 tests  \n   - Integration: TC_008, TC_014, TC_015, TC_016, TC_021, TC_022 → 6 tests (some overlap with positive)  \n   - Security: TC_017, TC_018 → 2 tests  \n   - Performance: TC_019, TC_020 → 2 tests  \n\n   This mix provides broad coverage of functionality, error handling, edge conditions, cross-feature integration, security, and performance.\n\n4. **Risk Areas**  \n   - **Data loss / corruption:** Binary imports overwrite the entire database and invalidate endpoint sessions; incorrect handling or invalid file imports pose high risk.  \n   - **Incorrect append/overwrite behavior:** Misimplementation of CSV semantics (append vs overwrite existing fields) could cause stale or inconsistent device data.  \n   - **Upgrade compatibility:** Inability to restore pre-upgrade backups or import pre-upgrade CSVs threatens recoverability after upgrade.  \n   - **Security of backups:** Exported database and CSVs may contain sensitive endpoint information; improper access control or missing password protection increases exposure risk.  \n   - **Performance at scale:** Large database or CSV imports/exports may degrade system performance or cause outages if not optimized.  \n   - **Integration consistency:** Discrepancies between imported data and what dashboards/reports, Device Attribute Server, or Forward and Sync modules display could lead to incorrect policy decisions.",
